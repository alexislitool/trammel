### documentation

Trammel provides a set of functions used to ease the inclusion of [contracts-programming](cp.html) for the [Clojure](http://clojure.org) programming language.  In addition
to providing a DSL for defining functions that adhere to a specific contract, Trammel provides a way to define isolated contracts that can later be applied to 
existing functions at runtime.  Below you will find a more information on both approaches to contracts:

 - [Applying Contracts to Existing Functions](provide-contracts/)
 - [Defining Constrained Functions](defconstrainedfn/)
 - [Defining Isolated Unnamed Contracts](contract/)
 - [Defining Isolated Named Contracts](defcontract/)
 - [Applying Contracts Manually](with-constraints/)
